I developed a Content Engine ChatBot, focusing on analyzing and comparing multiple PDF documents. This system leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to efficiently retrieve, assess, and generate insights from the documents. The project involved creating a scalable and modular architecture that ensures data privacy by using local instances of models and embeddings.
